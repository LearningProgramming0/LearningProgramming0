### I am a little adventurer in the world of programming. I am currently learning to use this platform, so my profile is probably not the most interesting

**Skills:** HTML / CSS / MD

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Training Full Developer** 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on **creation of websites and applications** 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with anything related to **programming** 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I trained to be a teacher, but I have decided to make a **radical change**
